# Audio Visualizer

## Description
The **Audio Visualizer** is a dynamic graphic component intended to encircle the `Orb Menu` or sit within the Player Controller.

## Key Features
*   **Purpose**: To provide real-time visual feedback based on the audio output of the media engine (MPV/WebView2).

*   **Visuals**: Enhances the "Living" feel of the application, replacing static UI elements with reactive motion.
